Tejan’s feedback:
1- On the first page, it should not show the other navigation links like student,staff.When you do login then only it should show details.
2- You need to put change password functionality
3- You should have forgotten password or some functionality which helps user to recover password
4- When you create student or staff and when you press create button,it should only display “Create successfully” or you can show “create successfully”message and show the manage student page on the same page.
5- CREATE LESSON:
The label and textbox field should come in the same line.
